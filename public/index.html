    <!--TODO: So the Google API is called asynchronously,
     according to their instructions. Don't know why.
     In Vue it's a pain in the ass though.
         The callback function, initMap(), which I've already deleted,
     was emitting a custom event, to which the GoogleMap component
     became a listener. The problem was (I think so), that the event
     had been emitted before the component has managed to register
     as a listener of this event, so the component never heard the
     event and consequently, never triggered the function that
     creates a map and attaches it to the DOM.
         Now the Google API is called synchronously and the GoogleMap
     component does map creation and initialization on its own,
     without the need for external callback functions, events and such.  -->
